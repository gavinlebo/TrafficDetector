# TrafficDetector
Computer Vision model to detect traffic objects such as cars, trucks, bikes pedestrians etc. using the yoloV4 DNN with OpenCV in python. 

Before use download the DNN's weights file as well as .cfg file from https://github.com/AlexeyAB/darknet/releases, files were too large to commit. Use absolute path of image, as well as DNN file names within python script to avoid cv2 error.
